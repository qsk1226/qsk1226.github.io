# 
# 如果，bind没有特别指定，redis可以接受任意可访问到该服务IP的请求，
# 一般来说，只可能只监听一个或者多个IP的请求，不要完全开放。
#
#  ~~~ 注意 ~~~ 如果redis服务是运行在互联网可访问的环境下，暴露任意IP可访问是相当危险的。
# 所以，默认情况下，我们只开放127.0.0.1的可访问IP，那就意味着只有本地才能访问redis服务。
#
# 如果你非要开放，你就需要注释下面这段配置。
bind 127.0.0.1


# 保护模式是一个避免redis暴露在公网后可以任意访问的安全层。 
#
# 当在如下条件下，保护模式将开启：
# 1.服务没有明确绑定具体IP
# 2.服务没有配置密码
#
# 保护模式开启后，服务只能接受ipv4/v6的环路路由，或者unix socket。
#
# 默认情况下，保护模式是开启的，如果你确信要让客户端可以不需要密码访问
# redis服务，或者不明确bindIP的化，可以关闭保护模式。
protected-mode yes

# 监听端口
port 6379

# TCP listen() backlog.
# backlog其实是一个连接监听队列，backlog队列总和=未完成三次握手队列 + 已经完成三次握手队列。
# 在高并发的redis访问场景下，你需要提高tcp的监听队列大小，来避免慢客户端连接问题，否则将出现tcp连接耗尽问题
# 同时修改此处配置的时候，也要一并修改linux的系统参数/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn
# 否则不生效。somaxconn &gt;= tcp-backlog
tcp-backlog 511

# Unix socket.
#
# redis采用unix socket作为客户端的数据传输通道，据说可以提高25%的性能，但是只能用于本机进程间通信，
# 用处不大
# 默认不开启
# unixsocket /tmp/redis.sock
# unixsocketperm 700


# Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds (0 to disable)

# 客户端连接空闲后自动关闭的等待时间，0表示不关闭。

# TCP keepalive， tcp长连接
# 如果非0，redis的tcp连接将在长时间未通信的情况下发送心跳包给客户端
# 这样做有两个好处:
# 1.回收已断开的连接
# 2.在存在网络中间件，比如路由器，网关的条件下，保证连接的可用
# 在Linux系统中，这个数值标识TCP发送心跳包的时间间隔，在两次发送心跳包无响应时，将废弃该连接
# 在其他系统，可能有Kernels的内核参数决定心跳包时间，该参数无效。

# 默认情况下，redis不在后台运行，如果你需要后台静默运行，设置为yes.
# 后台运行的状态，redis将pid写入/var/run/redis.pid 文件
daemonize yes

# 如果redis是通过upstart或者systemd开机自启动，你可以将redis的运行状态，写入开机启动服务的状态数中
# 有四种选择
#   supervised no      - no supervision interaction
#   supervised upstart - signal upstart by putting Redis into SIGSTOP mode
#   supervised systemd - signal systemd by writing READY=1 to $NOTIFY_SOCKET
#   supervised auto    - detect upstart or systemd method based on
#                        UPSTART_JOB or NOTIFY_SOCKET environment variables
# 注意：redis在开机启动树只有“运行中”这样的状态，没有是否可联通的状态，
# `个人理解:这块做关联启动，有些开机启动服务需要依赖redis的启动，所以增加这个配置`

# 如果pid文件有显式指定，redis在启动后，写入进程号，退出时，删除文件
# 当服务是非后台模式运行时，如果没有指定pid文件，redis将不会创建该文件，当服务是后台模式运行时，
# 即使没有指定pid文件，redis也会创建该文件，同时默认值为&quot;/var/run/redis.pid&quot;
# 创建pid是将会对redis的管理有好处，但是不创建也不会对redis运行有影响。

# 指定日志文件的名称，如果是空字符串，redis的日志将写入Linux的标准输出，
# 如果redis是后台模式运行，日志文件为&quot;&quot;,日志将输出到/dev/null，也就是不输出日志

# Save the DB on disk:
#
#   save &lt;seconds&gt; &lt;changes&gt;
#
# 格式：save &lt;间隔时间（秒）&gt; &lt;写入次数&gt;
# 根据给定的时间间隔和写入次数将数据保存到磁盘
# 下面的例子的意思是：
# 900 秒内如果至少有 1 个 key 的值变化，则保存
# 300 秒内如果至少有 10 个 key 的值变化，则保存
# 60 秒内如果至少有 10000 个 key 的值变化，则保存
# 注意：你可以注释掉所有的 save 行来停用保存功能。
# 也可以直接一个空字符串来实现停用：
#  数据的持久化的规则

save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000

# 如果用户开启了RDB快照功能，那么在redis持久化数据到磁盘时如果出现失败，默认情况下，redis会停止接受所有的写请求。
# 这样做的好处在于可以让用户很明确的知道内存中的数据和磁盘上的数据已经存在不一致了。
# 如果redis不顾这种不一致，一意孤行的继续接收写请求，就可能会引起一些灾难性的后果。
# 如果下一次RDB持久化成功，redis会自动恢复接受写请求。
# 如果不在乎这种数据不一致或者有其他的手段发现和控制这种不一致的话，可以关闭这个功能，
# 以便在快照写入失败时，也能确保redis继续接受新的写请求。

################################# REPLICATION （主从复制）#################################

# Master-Replica replication. Use replicaof to make a Redis instance a copy of
# another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.
#
#   +------------------+      +---------------+
#   |      Master      | ---&gt; |    Replica    |
#   | (receive writes) |      |  (exact copy) |
#   +------------------+      +---------------+
#
#
# 1）redis 主从复制是异步的，但是你可以设置，主节点没有一个正常运行的从节点时，禁止主节点写操作
# 2）redis从节点可以向主节点进行部分同步，这块你需要在下一个配置中指定同步块大小。
# 3）主从复制是自动进行的，不需要用户介入。

# replicaof &lt;masterip&gt; &lt;masterport&gt;

# 如果主节点设置了requirepass，从节点需要配置主节点的接入密码

# masterauth &lt;master-password&gt;

# 当一个 slave 与 master 失去联系，或者复制正在进行的时候，
# slave 可能会有两种表现：
# 1) 如果为 yes ，slave 仍然会应答客户端请求，但返回的数据可能是过时，
#    或者数据可能是空的在第一次同步的时候
# 2) 如果为 no ，在你执行除了 info he salveof 之外的其他命令时，
#    slave 都将返回一个 &quot;SYNC with master in progress&quot; 的错误
replica-serve-stale-data yes

#你可以配置一个 slave 实体是否接受写入操作。
#通过写入操作来存储一些短暂的数据对于一个 slave 实例来说可能是有用的，
#因为相对从 master 重新同步数而言，据数据写入到 slave 会更容易被删除。
#但是如果客户端因为一个错误的配置写入，也可能会导致一些问题。
#从 redis 2.6 版起，默认 slaves 都是只读的。
replica-read-only yes

# 主从同步策略：disk和socket
#
# -------------------------------------------------------
# 注意：socket同步是实验性功能
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# Disk-backed策略在新同步和重连同步无法进行增量同步，只能进行全量同步。
# 主从同步有两种方式，默认采用Disk-backed
#
# 1) Disk-backed: redis新建一个独立进程，将RDB写入到磁盘，稍后由父进程将数据传输给各个节点。
# 
# 2) Diskless: redis创建一个独立进程，直接将数据通过与从节点的socket通道传递，无需写入硬盘。
#
# 在disk-backed的策略下，RDB数据是持有化到磁盘的，多个从节点再逐个接收数据，无法同时传输。
# 在diskless的策略下，从节点一旦接入主节点，在等待指定的时间后，主从开始通过socket传递数据，多个从节点可以同时进行。
#
# 如果在磁盘读写慢，网络速度快的环境下，可以采用diskless
# works better.
repl-diskless-sync no

# 当采用diskless的同步策略启动时，可以配置从节点接入主节点后，等待多少时间后，进行同步。
# 当启用无硬盘备份，服务器等待一段时间后才会通过套接字向从站传送RDB文件，这个等待时间是可配置的。
# 这一点很重要，因为一旦传送开始，就不可能再为一个新到达的从站服务。从站则要排队等待下一次RDB传送。因此服务器等待一段
# 时间以期更多的从站到达。
# 延迟时间以秒为单位，默认为5秒。要关掉这一功能，只需将它设置为0秒，传送会立即启动。
repl-diskless-sync-delay 5

# 从redis会周期性的向主redis发出PING包，你可以通过repl_ping_slave_period指令来控制其周期，默认是10秒
# repl-ping-replica-period 10

# 接下来的选项为以下内容设置备份的超时时间：
# 1）从从站的角度，同步期间的批量传输的I/O
# 2）从站角度认为的主站超时（数据，ping）
# 3）主站角度认为的从站超时（REPLCONF ACK pings)
# 确认这些值比定义的repl-ping-slave-period要大，否则每次主站和从站之间通信低速时都会被检测为超时。
# repl-timeout 60

#同步之后是否禁用从站上的TCP_NODELAY
#如果你选择yes，redis会使用较少量的TCP包和带宽向从站发送数据。但这会导致在从站增加一点数据的延时。
#Linux内核默认配置情况下最多40毫秒的延时。
#如果选择no，从站的数据延时不会那么多，但备份需要的带宽相对较多。
#默认情况下我们将潜在因素优化，但在高负载情况下或者在主从站都跳的情况下，把它切换为yes是个好主意。
repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no


# 设置备份的工作储备大小。工作储备是一个缓冲区，当从站断开一段时间的情况时，它替从站接收存储数据，
# 因此当从站重连时，通常不需要完全备份，只需要一个部分同步就可以，即把从站断开时错过的一部分数据接收。
# 工作储备越大，从站可以断开并稍后执行部分同步的断开时间就越长。
# 只要有一个从站连接，就会立刻分配一个工作储备。
# repl-backlog-size 1mb


# 主站有一段时间没有与从站连接，对应的工作储备就会自动释放。
# 这个选项用于配置释放前等待的秒数，秒数从断开的那一刻开始计算，值为0表示不释放。
# repl-backlog-ttl 3600

#从站优先级是可以从redis的INFO命令输出中查到的一个整数。当主站不能正常工作时
#redis sentinel使用它来选择一个从站并将它提升为主站。
#优先级的从站被认为更适合于提升，因此如果有三个从站优先级分别是10，100，25，sentinel会选择优先级为10的从站，因为它的优先级最低。
#然而优先级值为0的从站不能执行主站的角色，因此优先级为0的从站永远不会被redis sentinel提升。
#默认优先级是100
replica-priority 100

# It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than
# N replicas connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.
#
# The N replicas need to be in &quot;online&quot; state.
#
# The lag in seconds, that must be &lt;= the specified value, is calculated from
# the last ping received from the replica, that is usually sent every second.
#
# This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but
# will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough replicas
# are available, to the specified number of seconds.
#
# For example to require at least 3 replicas with a lag &lt;= 10 seconds use:
#
# min-replicas-to-write 3
# min-replicas-max-lag 10
#
# Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.
#
# By default min-replicas-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and
# min-replicas-max-lag is set to 10.

# A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached
# replicas in different ways. For example the &quot;INFO replication&quot; section
# offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by
# Redis Sentinel in order to discover replica instances.
# Another place where this info is available is in the output of the
# &quot;ROLE&quot; command of a master.
#
# The listed IP and address normally reported by a replica is obtained
# in the following way:
#
#   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address
#   of the socket used by the replica to connect with the master.
#
#   Port: The port is communicated by the replica during the replication
#   handshake, and is normally the port that the replica is using to
#   listen for connections.
#
# However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is
# used, the replica may be actually reachable via different IP and port
# pairs. The following two options can be used by a replica in order to
# report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO
# and ROLE will report those values.
#
# There is no need to use both the options if you need to override just
# the port or the IP address.
#
# replica-announce-ip 5.5.5.5
# replica-announce-port 1234

############################## MEMORY MANAGEMENT ################################

# maxmemory 可以设置redis的最大占用内存，如果redis实际使用达到阈值，
# 将按照maxmemory-policy策略移除key
# 如果redis不能通过策略移除，或者策略采用的是noeviction，redis将回报错误，对于一些写的指令
# 比如SET，LPUSH这些指令，但是读的指令可以正常回报
#
# 这个选项一般让redis作为LRU或者LFU的缓存服务，如果策略设置为noeviction，限制将是物理内存大小。
#
# WARNING: If you have replicas attached to an instance with maxmemory on,
# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the replicas are subtracted
# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will
# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output
# buffer of replicas is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion
# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.
#
# In short... if you have replicas attached it is suggested that you set a lower
# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for replica
# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').
#
# maxmemory &lt;bytes&gt;

# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
# is reached. You can select among five behaviors:
#
# volatile-lru -&gt; Evict using approximated LRU among the keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lru -&gt; Evict any key using approximated LRU.
# volatile-lfu -&gt; Evict using approximated LFU among the keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lfu -&gt; Evict any key using approximated LFU.
# volatile-random -&gt; Remove a random key among the ones with an expire set.
# allkeys-random -&gt; Remove a random key, any key.
# volatile-ttl -&gt; Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
# noeviction -&gt; Don't evict anything, just return an error on write operations.
#
# LRU means Least Recently Used
# LFU means Least Frequently Used
#
# Both LRU, LFU and volatile-ttl are implemented using approximated
# randomized algorithms.
#
# Note: with any of the above policies, Redis will return an error on write
#       operations, when there are no suitable keys for eviction.
#
#       At the date of writing these commands are: set setnx setex append
#       incr decr rpush lpush rpushx lpushx linsert lset rpoplpush sadd
#       sinter sinterstore sunion sunionstore sdiff sdiffstore zadd zincrby
#       zunionstore zinterstore hset hsetnx hmset hincrby incrby decrby
#       getset mset msetnx exec sort
#
# The default is:
#
# maxmemory-policy noeviction

# LRU, LFU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or
# accuracy. For default Redis will check five keys and pick the one that was
# used less recently, you can change the sample size using the following
# configuration directive.
#
# The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely
# true LRU but costs more CPU. 3 is faster but not very accurate.
#
# maxmemory-samples 5

# Starting from Redis 5, by default a replica will ignore its maxmemory setting
# (unless it is promoted to master after a failover or manually). It means
# that the eviction of keys will be just handled by the master, sending the
# DEL commands to the replica as keys evict in the master side.
#
# This behavior ensures that masters and replicas stay consistent, and is usually
# what you want, however if your replica is writable, or you want the replica to have
# a different memory setting, and you are sure all the writes performed to the
# replica are idempotent, then you may change this default (but be sure to understand
# what you are doing).
#
# Note that since the replica by default does not evict, it may end using more
# memory than the one set via maxmemory (there are certain buffers that may
# be larger on the replica, or data structures may sometimes take more memory and so
# forth). So make sure you monitor your replicas and make sure they have enough
# memory to never hit a real out-of-memory condition before the master hits
# the configured maxmemory setting.
#
# replica-ignore-maxmemory yes

############################# LAZY FREEING ####################################

# Redis has two primitives to delete keys. One is called DEL and is a blocking
# deletion of the object. It means that the server stops processing new commands
# in order to reclaim all the memory associated with an object in a synchronous
# way. If the key deleted is associated with a small object, the time needed
# in order to execute the DEL command is very small and comparable to most other
# O(1) or O(log_N) commands in Redis. However if the key is associated with an
# aggregated value containing millions of elements, the server can block for
# a long time (even seconds) in order to complete the operation.
#
# For the above reasons Redis also offers non blocking deletion primitives
# such as UNLINK (non blocking DEL) and the ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and
# FLUSHDB commands, in order to reclaim memory in background. Those commands
# are executed in constant time. Another thread will incrementally free the
# object in the background as fast as possible.
#
# DEL, UNLINK and ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and FLUSHDB are user-controlled.
# It's up to the design of the application to understand when it is a good
# idea to use one or the other. However the Redis server sometimes has to
# delete keys or flush the whole database as a side effect of other operations.
# Specifically Redis deletes objects independently of a user call in the
# following scenarios:
#
# 1) On eviction, because of the maxmemory and maxmemory policy configurations,
#    in order to make room for new data, without going over the specified
#    memory limit.
# 2) Because of expire: when a key with an associated time to live (see the
#    EXPIRE command) must be deleted from memory.
# 3) Because of a side effect of a command that stores data on a key that may
#    already exist. For example the RENAME command may delete the old key
#    content when it is replaced with another one. Similarly SUNIONSTORE
#    or SORT with STORE option may delete existing keys. The SET command
#    itself removes any old content of the specified key in order to replace
#    it with the specified string.
# 4) During replication, when a replica performs a full resynchronization with
#    its master, the content of the whole database is removed in order to
#    load the RDB file just transferred.
#
# In all the above cases the default is to delete objects in a blocking way,
# like if DEL was called. However you can configure each case specifically
# in order to instead release memory in a non-blocking way like if UNLINK
# was called, using the following configuration directives:

lazyfree-lazy-eviction no
lazyfree-lazy-expire no
lazyfree-lazy-server-del no
replica-lazy-flush no

############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################

# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or
# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
# the configured save points).
#
# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a
# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is
# still running correctly.
#
# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file
# with the better durability guarantees.
#
# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.

appendonly no

# The name of the append only file (default: &quot;appendonly.aof&quot;)

appendfilename &quot;appendonly.aof&quot;

# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
#
# Redis supports three different modes:
#
# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
#
# The default is &quot;everysec&quot;, as that's usually the right compromise between
# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
# &quot;no&quot; that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
# or on the contrary, use &quot;always&quot; that's very slow but a bit safer than
# everysec.
#
# More details please check the following article:
# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html
#
# If unsure, use &quot;everysec&quot;.

# appendfsync always
appendfsync everysec
# appendfsync no

# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations
# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for
# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block
# our synchronous write(2) call.
#
# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
#
# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is
# the same as &quot;appendfsync none&quot;. In practical terms, this means that it is
# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the
# default Linux settings).
#
# If you have latency problems turn this to &quot;yes&quot;. Otherwise leave it as
# &quot;no&quot; that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.

no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no

# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.
# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling
# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.
#
# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the
# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of
# the AOF at startup is used).
#
# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is
# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also
# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this
# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase
# is reached but it is still pretty small.
#
# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF
# rewrite feature.

auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb

# An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis
# startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.
# This may happen when the system where Redis is running
# crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the
# data=ordered option (however this can't happen when Redis itself
# crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).
#
# Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much
# data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found
# to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.
#
# If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and
# the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.
# Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error
# and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires
# to fix the AOF file using the &quot;redis-check-aof&quot; utility before to restart
# the server.
#
# Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle
# the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when
# Redis will try to read more data from the AOF file but not enough bytes
# will be found.
aof-load-truncated yes

# When rewriting the AOF file, Redis is able to use an RDB preamble in the
# AOF file for faster rewrites and recoveries. When this option is turned
# on the rewritten AOF file is composed of two different stanzas:
#
#   [RDB file][AOF tail]
#
# When loading Redis recognizes that the AOF file starts with the &quot;REDIS&quot;
# string and loads the prefixed RDB file, and continues loading the AOF
# tail.
aof-use-rdb-preamble yes

################################ LUA SCRIPTING  ###############################

# Max execution time of a Lua script in milliseconds.
#
# If the maximum execution time is reached Redis will log that a script is
# still in execution after the maximum allowed time and will start to
# reply to queries with an error.
#
# When a long running script exceeds the maximum execution time only the
# SCRIPT KILL and SHUTDOWN NOSAVE commands are available. The first can be
# used to stop a script that did not yet called write commands. The second
# is the only way to shut down the server in the case a write command was
# already issued by the script but the user doesn't want to wait for the natural
# termination of the script.

# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# WARNING EXPERIMENTAL: Redis Cluster is considered to be stable code, however
# in order to mark it as &quot;mature&quot; we need to wait for a non trivial percentage
# of users to deploy it in production.
# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#
# 一般情况下，redis未开启集群模式，只有开启如下参数，才能开启集群模式。
#
# cluster-enabled yes

#
# 每个集群节点都有集群配置文件，这个文件不是用来提供给使用者编辑，
# 它将由集群节点自身创建并通过集群通信后修改。
# 每个集群节点如果在同一个宿主机上都要有不同的文件，否则将会被覆盖。
# cluster-config-file nodes-6379.conf


# 集群节点被认定为不可达的时间阈值，单位是毫秒。
# 大多数时间节点的阈值都是超时时间的整数倍。
# cluster-node-timeout 15000

# A replica of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data
# looks too old.
# 故障主节点的备份将在数据太旧的时候启动失败。
#
# 目前没有简易的方法判断数据是否过旧，一般采用如下两种判定：
# 1）如果有多个故障备份，他们将交换数据对备份数据的时间进行排序，
#     取最新的故障节点作为主节点。
# 1) If there are multiple replicas able to failover, they exchange messages
#    in order to try to give an advantage to the replica with the best
#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).
#    Replicas will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start
#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.
# 2）
# 2) Every single replica computes the time of the last interaction with
#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master
#    is still in the &quot;connected&quot; state), or the time that elapsed since the
#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).
#    If the last interaction is too old, the replica will not try to failover
#    at all.
#
# The point &quot;2&quot; can be tuned by user. Specifically a replica will not perform
# the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time
# elapsed is greater than:
#
#   (node-timeout * replica-validity-factor) + repl-ping-replica-period
#
# So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the replica-validity-factor
# is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-replica-period of 10 seconds, the
# replica will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master
# for longer than 310 seconds.
#
# A large replica-validity-factor may allow replicas with too old data to failover
# a master, while a too small value may prevent the cluster from being able to
# elect a replica at all.
#
# For maximum availability, it is possible to set the replica-validity-factor
# to a value of 0, which means, that replicas will always try to failover the
# master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.
# (However they'll always try to apply a delay proportional to their
# offset rank).
#
# Zero is the only value able to guarantee that when all the partitions heal
# the cluster will always be able to continue.
#
# cluster-replica-validity-factor 10

# Cluster replicas are able to migrate to orphaned masters, that are masters
# that are left without working replicas. This improves the cluster ability
# to resist to failures as otherwise an orphaned master can't be failed over
# in case of failure if it has no working replicas.
#
# Replicas migrate to orphaned masters only if there are still at least a
# given number of other working replicas for their old master. This number
# is the &quot;migration barrier&quot;. A migration barrier of 1 means that a replica
# will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working replica for its master
# and so forth. It usually reflects the number of replicas you want for every
# master in your cluster.
#
# Default is 1 (replicas migrate only if their masters remain with at least
# one replica). To disable migration just set it to a very large value.
# A value of 0 can be set but is useful only for debugging and dangerous
# in production.
#
# cluster-migration-barrier 1

# By default Redis Cluster nodes stop accepting queries if they detect there
# is at least an hash slot uncovered (no available node is serving it).
# This way if the cluster is partially down (for example a range of hash slots
# are no longer covered) all the cluster becomes, eventually, unavailable.
# It automatically returns available as soon as all the slots are covered again.
#
# However sometimes you want the subset of the cluster which is working,
# to continue to accept queries for the part of the key space that is still
# covered. In order to do so, just set the cluster-require-full-coverage
# option to no.
#
# cluster-require-full-coverage yes

# This option, when set to yes, prevents replicas from trying to failover its
# master during master failures. However the master can still perform a
# manual failover, if forced to do so.
#
# This is useful in different scenarios, especially in the case of multiple
# data center operations, where we want one side to never be promoted if not
# in the case of a total DC failure.
#
# cluster-replica-no-failover no

# In order to setup your cluster make sure to read the documentation
# available at http://redis.io web site.

########################## CLUSTER DOCKER/NAT support  ########################

# 在某些环境，redis集群节点的地址发现是失败的。主要原因是NAT网络或者Docker等容器化环境，导致地址发现是错误的。
# 
# 为了解决redis在这些网络环境的正常运行，redis提供的可配置化的可访问IP配置。
# 如下是配置参数：
#
# * cluster-announce-ip
# * cluster-announce-port
# * cluster-announce-bus-port
# 
#
# 如果这些配置未开启，使用默认的集群自动发现。
# 
# Note that when remapped, the bus port may not be at the fixed offset of
# clients port + 10000, so you can specify any port and bus-port depending
# on how they get remapped. If the bus-port is not set, a fixed offset of
# 10000 will be used as usually.
#
# 一般来说，数据端口(port)和集群信息交换（bus-port）约定是port+10000.
# Example:
#
# cluster-announce-ip 10.1.1.5
# cluster-announce-port 6379
# cluster-announce-bus-port 6380

################################## SLOW LOG ###################################

# redis慢日志是为了记录执行时间过长的指令。这些指令不包含IO操作，比如和客户端的数据通，只是记录

#
# 你可以配置慢日志的两个参数，一个是慢日志的界定阈值，单位是微秒，另一个是慢日志的指令最大数量，
# 超过最大数量，旧的慢日志将被删除。


# 下面单位是微秒，1秒要写成1000000，如果数值为负数，表示不记录慢日志，如果数值为0，将会记录每条指令

# redis延时监控是为了在运行状态收集redis的慢操作（和慢日志的区别，其监控范围更广，不仅包括命令耗时，还包括内部指令，比如key过期回收这些的耗时）
# 通过latency可以打印耗时图表
# 通过latency-monitor-threshold（单位毫秒）的阈值记录延时日志，如果设置0，表示关闭延时日志监控。

# 延时监控开启后，会有一定的性能损耗，不过相当小，即使在大负载运行的情
# 延时监控也可以通过CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold &lt;milliseconds&gt;来进行热启动
latency-monitor-threshold 0

############################# EVENT NOTIFICATION ##############################

# Redis can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.
# This feature is documented at http://redis.io/topics/notifications
#
# For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client
# performs a DEL operation on key &quot;foo&quot; stored in the Database 0, two
# messages will be published via Pub/Sub:
#
# PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del
# PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo
#
# It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set
# of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:
#
#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@&lt;db&gt;__ prefix.
#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@&lt;db&gt;__ prefix.
#  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...
#  $     String commands
#  l     List commands
#  s     Set commands
#  h     Hash commands
#  z     Sorted set commands
#  x     Expired events (events generated every time a key expires)
#  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)
#  A     Alias for g$lshzxe, so that the &quot;AKE&quot; string means all the events.
#
#  The &quot;notify-keyspace-events&quot; takes as argument a string that is composed
#  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications
#  are disabled.
#
#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the
#           event name, use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Elg
#
#  Example 2: to get the stream of the expired keys subscribing to channel
#             name __keyevent@0__:expired use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Ex
#
#  By default all notifications are disabled because most users don't need
#  this feature and the feature has some overhead. Note that if you don't
#  specify at least one of K or E, no events will be delivered.

############################### ADVANCED CONFIG ###############################

# Hashes are encoded using a memory efficient data structure when they have a
# small number of entries, and the biggest entry does not exceed a given
# threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.
hash-max-ziplist-entries 512
hash-max-ziplist-value 64

# Lists are also encoded in a special way to save a lot of space.
# The number of entries allowed per internal list node can be specified
# as a fixed maximum size or a maximum number of elements.
# For a fixed maximum size, use -5 through -1, meaning:
# -5: max size: 64 Kb  &lt;-- not recommended for normal workloads
# -4: max size: 32 Kb  &lt;-- not recommended
# -3: max size: 16 Kb  &lt;-- probably not recommended
# -2: max size: 8 Kb   &lt;-- good
# -1: max size: 4 Kb   &lt;-- good
# Positive numbers mean store up to _exactly_ that number of elements
# per list node.
# The highest performing option is usually -2 (8 Kb size) or -1 (4 Kb size),
# but if your use case is unique, adjust the settings as necessary.
list-max-ziplist-size -2

# Lists may also be compressed.
# Compress depth is the number of quicklist ziplist nodes from *each* side of
# the list to *exclude* from compression.  The head and tail of the list
# are always uncompressed for fast push/pop operations.  Settings are:
# 0: disable all list compression
# 1: depth 1 means &quot;don't start compressing until after 1 node into the list,
#    going from either the head or tail&quot;
#    So: [head]-&gt;node-&gt;node-&gt;...-&gt;node-&gt;[tail]
#    [head], [tail] will always be uncompressed; inner nodes will compress.
# 2: [head]-&gt;[next]-&gt;node-&gt;node-&gt;...-&gt;node-&gt;[prev]-&gt;[tail]
#    2 here means: don't compress head or head-&gt;next or tail-&gt;prev or tail,
#    but compress all nodes between them.
# 3: [head]-&gt;[next]-&gt;[next]-&gt;node-&gt;node-&gt;...-&gt;node-&gt;[prev]-&gt;[prev]-&gt;[tail]
# etc.

# Sets have a special encoding in just one case: when a set is composed

# of 64 bit signed integers.
# The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of the
# set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.
set-max-intset-entries 512

# Similarly to hashes and lists, sorted sets are also specially encoded in
# order to save a lot of space. This encoding is only used when the length and
# elements of a sorted set are below the following limits:
zset-max-ziplist-entries 128
zset-max-ziplist-value 64

# HyperLogLog sparse representation bytes limit. The limit includes the
# 16 bytes header. When an HyperLogLog using the sparse representation crosses
# this limit, it is converted into the dense representation.
#
# A value greater than 16000 is totally useless, since at that point the
# dense representation is more memory efficient.
#
# The suggested value is ~ 3000 in order to have the benefits of
# the space efficient encoding without slowing down too much PFADD,
# which is O(N) with the sparse encoding. The value can be raised to
# ~ 10000 when CPU is not a concern, but space is, and the data set is
# composed of many HyperLogLogs with cardinality in the 0 - 15000 range.
hll-sparse-max-bytes 3000

# Streams macro node max size / items. The stream data structure is a radix
# tree of big nodes that encode multiple items inside. Using this configuration
# it is possible to configure how big a single node can be in bytes, and the
# maximum number of items it may contain before switching to a new node when
# appending new stream entries. If any of the following settings are set to
# zero, the limit is ignored, so for instance it is possible to set just a
# max entires limit by setting max-bytes to 0 and max-entries to the desired
# value.
stream-node-max-bytes 4096
stream-node-max-entries 100

# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in
# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level
# keys to values). The hash table implementation Redis uses (see dict.c)
# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table
# that is rehashing, the more rehashing &quot;steps&quot; are performed, so if the
# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used
# by the hash table.
#
# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to
# actively rehash the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.

# use &quot;activerehashing no&quot; if you have hard latency requirements and it is
# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply from time to time
# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.
#
# use &quot;activerehashing yes&quot; if you don't have such hard requirements but
# want to free memory asap when possible.
activerehashing yes

# The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients
# that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a
# common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the
# publisher can produce them).
#
# The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:
#
# normal -&gt; normal clients including MONITOR clients
# replica  -&gt; replica clients
# pubsub -&gt; clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern
#
# The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:
#
# client-output-buffer-limit &lt;class&gt; &lt;hard limit&gt; &lt;soft limit&gt; &lt;soft seconds&gt;
#
# A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if
# the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of
# seconds (continuously).
# So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is
# 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately
# if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get
# disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes
# the limit for 10 seconds.
#
# By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data
# without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only
# asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster
# than it can read.
#
# Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and replica clients, since
# subscribers and replicas receive data in a push fashion.
#
# Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.
client-output-buffer-limit normal 0 0 0
client-output-buffer-limit replica 256mb 64mb 60
client-output-buffer-limit pubsub 32mb 8mb 60

# Client query buffers accumulate new commands. They are limited to a fixed
# amount by default in order to avoid that a protocol desynchronization (for
# instance due to a bug in the client) will lead to unbound memory usage in
# the query buffer. However you can configure it here if you have very special
# needs, such us huge multi/exec requests or alike.
#
# client-query-buffer-limit 1gb

# In the Redis protocol, bulk requests, that are, elements representing single
# strings, are normally limited ot 512 mb. However you can change this limit
# here.
#
# proto-max-bulk-len 512mb

# Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like
# closing connections of clients in timeout, purging expired keys that are
# never requested, and so forth.
#
# Not all tasks are performed with the same frequency, but Redis checks for
# tasks to perform according to the specified &quot;hz&quot; value.
#
# By default &quot;hz&quot; is set to 10. Raising the value will use more CPU when
# Redis is idle, but at the same time will make Redis more responsive when
# there are many keys expiring at the same time, and timeouts may be
# handled with more precision.
#
# The range is between 1 and 500, however a value over 100 is usually not
# a good idea. Most users should use the default of 10 and raise this up to
# 100 only in environments where very low latency is required.
hz 10

# Normally it is useful to have an HZ value which is proportional to the
# number of clients connected. This is useful in order, for instance, to
# avoid too many clients are processed for each background task invocation
# in order to avoid latency spikes.
#
# Since the default HZ value by default is conservatively set to 10, Redis
# offers, and enables by default, the ability to use an adaptive HZ value
# which will temporary raise when there are many connected clients.
#
# When dynamic HZ is enabled, the actual configured HZ will be used as
# as a baseline, but multiples of the configured HZ value will be actually
# used as needed once more clients are connected. In this way an idle
# instance will use very little CPU time while a busy instance will be
# more responsive.
dynamic-hz yes

# When a child rewrites the AOF file, if the following option is enabled
# the file will be fsync-ed every 32 MB of data generated. This is useful
# in order to commit the file to the disk more incrementally and avoid
# big latency spikes.
aof-rewrite-incremental-fsync yes

# When redis saves RDB file, if the following option is enabled
# the file will be fsync-ed every 32 MB of data generated. This is useful
# in order to commit the file to the disk more incrementally and avoid
# big latency spikes.
rdb-save-incremental-fsync yes

# Redis LFU eviction (see maxmemory setting) can be tuned. However it is a good
# idea to start with the default settings and only change them after investigating
# how to improve the performances and how the keys LFU change over time, which
# is possible to inspect via the OBJECT FREQ command.
#
# There are two tunable parameters in the Redis LFU implementation: the
# counter logarithm factor and the counter decay time. It is important to
# understand what the two parameters mean before changing them.
#
# The LFU counter is just 8 bits per key, it's maximum value is 255, so Redis
# uses a probabilistic increment with logarithmic behavior. Given the value
# of the old counter, when a key is accessed, the counter is incremented in
# this way:
#
# 1. A random number R between 0 and 1 is extracted.
# 2. A probability P is calculated as 1/(old_value*lfu_log_factor+1).
# 3. The counter is incremented only if R &lt; P.
#
# The default lfu-log-factor is 10. This is a table of how the frequency
# counter changes with a different number of accesses with different
# logarithmic factors:
#
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | factor | 100 hits   | 1000 hits  | 100K hits  | 1M hits    | 10M hits   |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 0      | 104        | 255        | 255        | 255        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 1      | 18         | 49         | 255        | 255        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 10     | 10         | 18         | 142        | 255        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 100    | 8          | 11         | 49         | 143        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
#
# NOTE: The above table was obtained by running the following commands:
#
#   redis-benchmark -n 1000000 incr foo
#   redis-cli object freq foo
#
# NOTE 2: The counter initial value is 5 in order to give new objects a chance
# to accumulate hits.
#
# The counter decay time is the time, in minutes, that must elapse in order
# for the key counter to be divided by two (or decremented if it has a value
# less &lt;= 10).
#
# The default value for the lfu-decay-time is 1. A Special value of 0 means to
# decay the counter every time it happens to be scanned.
#
# lfu-log-factor 10
# lfu-decay-time 1

########################### ACTIVE DEFRAGMENTATION #######################
#
# 注意，该特性是实验性的，尽管经过了众多开发者生产环境验证和人工测试，但还是不能保证没问题。
#
# 什么是碎片热整理？
# -------------------------------
# 碎片热整理是让redis整合内存空间的碎片化数据块和废弃数据，这样可以回收更大的内存空间用于分配。
# 
# 
# Fragmentation is a natural process that happens with every allocator (but
# less so with Jemalloc, fortunately) and certain workloads. 
# 一般来说，服务需要重启才能减少内存碎片，或至少要释放所有数据内存，再次重新构建一次内存数据。
# 然而，感谢Oran Agra在redis4.0实现了服务在运行时可整理碎片的机制。
#
# 基本上，当碎片达到一定级别（看下方的配置），redis将在临近的内存区域通过Jemalloc（可以更好的实现内存回收和碎片整理）构建一个备份，
# 同时，将释放旧的内存数据，这个进程采用递增的方式逐个处理key值直到内存碎片降低的合理值。
#
# 重要的知识点:
#
# 1. This feature is disabled by default, and only works if you compiled Redis
#    to use the copy of Jemalloc we ship with the source code of Redis.
#    This is the default with Linux builds.
# 2.你不需要开启该特性，如果你的系统没有碎片问题。
# 3.一旦你想体验该特性，你可以通过CONFIG SET activedefrag yes指令开启
#
# 如下配置将更好的调整碎片整理的行为。如果你不确定参数的作用，建议采用默认值。
